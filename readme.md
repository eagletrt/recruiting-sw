# Recruiting software 2022/23

Welcome to the recruiting repository of the software team at E-Agle Trento Racing Team.

This test is designed to get an idea of your technical skills and workflow. Assignments are built around the tools we use daily while developing software for our vehicle.

You have **2 weeks** to complete the project. Time assigned is not representative of the effort needed to finish the work, it is instead calculated to give you the option of working at your own pace, with plenty of time to **ask questions**.

To see the specific assignments please follow one of the following links, based on the team you were assigned to.

- [Microcontrollers](./microcontrollers/readme.md)
- [Steering wheel](./steering_wheel/readme.md)
- [Telemetry](./telemetry/readme.md)

## Feedback

Feedback on the assignments is very welcome and encouraged. Feel free to ask questions or propose a change by writing us at fsae@eagletrt.it, messaging your recruiter on telegram, or by visiting us at Povo 2, Floor -2.
