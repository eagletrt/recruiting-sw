# Recruiting software 2024/25

Welcome to the recruiting repository of the software team at E-Agle Trento Racing Team.

This test is designed to get an idea of your technical skills and workflow. Assignments are built around the tools we use daily while developing software for our vehicle.

You have **2 weeks** to complete the project. Time assigned is not representative of the effort needed to finish the work, it is instead calculated to give you the option of working at your own pace, with plenty of time to **ask questions**.

## Software

To see the specific assignments please follow one of the following links, based on the team you were assigned to.

- [Microcontrollers](./microcontrollers/readme.md)
- [Steering wheel](./steering_wheel/readme.md)
- [Telemetry](./telemetry/readme.md)
- [Driverless](./driverless/readme.md)

## Usage

Download this repo. **Don't fork it**.
Create a new public repository on your GitHub account named:

```text
recruiting-sw-<project-you-chose>
```

Then send us the link of the repo so that we will be able to review it.
