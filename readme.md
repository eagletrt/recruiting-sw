# Recruiting software 2022/23

Welcome to the recruiting repository of the software team at E-Agle Trento Racing Team.

This test is designed to get an idea of your technical skills and workflow. Assignments are built around the tools we use daily while developing software for our vehicle.

You have **2 weeks** to complete the project. Time assigned is not representative of the effort needed to finish the work, it is instead calculated to give you the option of working at your own pace, with plenty of time to **ask questions**.

> ⚠️ If you are submitting an application in the spring 2023 openings the only SW available position are for the Driverless project

## Driverless

For the driverless project, you have to complete two driverless-specific tasks as specified in the following link on top of one of the many standard [SW recruitment projects](#software) according to the specific assignment, the deadline is still 2 weeks that, as stated before, it is plenty of time to develop everything.
