## **üìú Task Breakdown**

### **Level 1: Implement a Kinematic Bicycle Model**
#### **Goal:**
- Setup a base C++ project using CMake.
- Implement a **kinematic bicycle model** to simulate vehicle motion.

#### **Requirements:**
- Implement the following equations of motion:
  \[
  x_{t+1} = x_t + v \cos(\theta) dt
  \]
  \[
  y_{t+1} = y_t + v \sin(\theta) dt
  \]
  \[
  \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \frac{v}{L} \tan(\delta) dt
  \]
  - Where:
    - \( v \) is velocity.
    - \( \delta \) is steering angle.
    - \( L \) is wheelbase.
    - \( \theta \) is heading.

- Simulate and plot the vehicle‚Äôs movement on a trajectory.
- Implement a visualization of the vehicle trajectory in **2D** using **raylib** or **imgui**.

#### **Bonus:**
- Add **acceleration and deceleration** to the model.

---

### **Level 2: Make the Vehicle Follow a Straight Path**
#### **Goal:**
- Implement a **simple heading correction** to keep the vehicle on a straight trajectory.

#### **Requirements:**
- Introduce **small disturbances** (e.g., noise in heading axis).
- Implement a **proportional control law**:
  \[
  \delta = K_p \cdot e
  \]
  - Where \( e \) is the heading error.
- Visualize how well the controller keeps the vehicle aligned.

#### **Bonus:**
- Introduce lateral drift and correct for it.

---

### **Level 3: Implement a Proportional Controller (P) for Steering**
#### **Goal:**
- Implement a **Proportional Controller** for trajectory tracking.

#### **Requirements:**
- Generate a **smooth path** for the vehicle to follow (e.g., a straight line, a sine wave and a more complex path).
- Given a **set of waypoints** from the generated path, use a **P controller** to adjust the steering angle:
  \[
  \delta = K_p \cdot e
  \]
  - Where \( e \) is the **cross-track error** (distance from the desired path).
- Visualize the vehicle‚Äôs trajectory and the **tracking error**.
- Tune the **\( K_p \)** value for optimal performance.

#### **Bonus:**
- Implement a **path planner** to generate more complex paths (e.g., a circle or a figure-eight).

---

### **Level 4: Upgrade to a PID Controller for Better Tracking**
#### **Goal:**
- Improve path tracking accuracy using a **PID controller**.

#### **Requirements:**
- Extend the **P-controller** to a **PID controller**:
  \[
  \delta = K_p e + K_d \frac{de}{dt} + K_i \int e dt
  \]
- Implement:
  - **Derivative (D) term** to reduce oscillations.
  - **Integral (I) term** to correct steady-state errors.
- Tune the **PID gains** to **minimize tracking error**.

#### **Bonus:**
- Test the PID controller on a **sharper track layout** (e.g., a chicane).

---

### **Level 5: Implement an Advanced Controller (25 Points)**
#### **Goal:**
- Implement **Stanley Control or Pure Pursuit Control**.

#### **Option 1: Stanley Controller**  
- Control law:
  \[
  \delta = \theta_e + \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{K e}{v} \right)
  \]
  - Where:
    - \( e \) is the cross-track error.
    - \( \theta_e \) is the heading error.

#### **Option 2: Pure Pursuit Controller**
- Control law:
  \[
  \delta = \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{2 L y}{L_d^2} \right)
  \]
  - Where:
    - \( y \) is the lookahead point.
    - \( L_d \) is the lookahead distance.

#### **Bonus:**
- Test different controller parameters and plot the **tracking performance** over time.

## **üéØ Bonus Challenges**
üèÜ **Extend to a Dynamic Bicycle Model**  
- Implement a **dynamic bicycle model** with:
  - Tire slip angles.
  - Lateral forces.
  - Understeer/oversteer behavior.

üèÜ **Implement Model Predictive Control (MPC)**  

This bonus point can be implemented using Python for the semplicity of finding solvers and tools to solve the formulated problems. To complete this point it is not necessary to reimplement everything from the above points, a simple vehicle model, problem formulation and plot of the result is sufficient.

- Formulate the control problem as an **optimization problem**.
- Use an **MPC solver (e.g., CasADi)** to predict the vehicle‚Äôs future states.

## **üèÜ Evaluation Criteria**
The goal of this task is to evaluate the ability of the candidate of solving problems and investigating new areas of study, it is not mandatory to complete all the points.
The criteria above are general guidelines for a good delivery, the **main criteria** on which the candidate will be evaluated is the **effort** put in the development of the project (even if it is not fully working).

‚úÖ **Completion:** Are all levels completed?  
‚úÖ **Code Quality:** Is the code **structured, readable, and documented**?  
‚úÖ **Controller Performance:** Does the vehicle follow the path accurately?  
‚úÖ **Efficiency:** Is the controller computationally efficient?

## **üí° Final Notes**
This task simulates **real-world autonomous vehicle control problems**. Candidates should **experiment with different techniques, optimize controller performance, and deliver a structured, well-documented solution**.


Good luck, future Driverless Engineers! üöóüí®
