# Recruiting driverless

> ⚠️ This document is fairly technical to maintain brevity, if you have **any** questions ask your recruiter or come visit us at floor -2 of Povo 2.

## Abstract

The driverless teamwork is characterized by the need of a broad skillset and an attitude to solve unforseen problems with little to no guidance.
In this recruiting you will be working on one or multiple are that are currently active in our team, the driverless project is composed of three main fields: perception, control and simulation. Each field is responsible of a part of our pipeline and by completing this task you will get a better understanding of what is involved in the development of an autonomous vehicle software stack and pipeline.

From the project you chose, we will test your programming skills, your approach to a problem and your solving process.  
Remember that the choices you make must have a foundation, and based on that an easier solution may be preferred to a more complex one.
